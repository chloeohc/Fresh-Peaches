# Fresh Peaches — Summer Internship Sales Forecasting Project

This repository contains my work completed during my **Summer 2025 internship at Fresh Peaches**, a Los Angeles–based startup focused on sustainable personal and home care products. Fresh Peaches sells biodegradable hygiene products and eco-friendly home essentials through direct-to-consumer channels, with a mission to make sustainable living more accessible and affordable.

## Project Overview

During my internship, I analyzed 12 months of transaction-level sales data to identify purchasing trends, clean inconsistencies, and develop predictive models for future performance. The primary goal was to **forecast product sales for the remainder of the year** to inform inventory planning and marketing decisions.

Key objectives:
- Clean and unify sales data across 30+ SKUs
- Calculate key performance metrics (MoM sales, AOV, product bundle frequency)
- Build forecasting models using **Facebook Prophet** and **SARIMA**
- Evaluate model accuracy and provide recommendations for next-quarter planning

## Methods & Tools

| Task | Approach |
